equivs (2.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to Policy 3.9.2 - no changes.
  * Upgrade to source format 1.0 - no changes.
  * Support Breaks.  (Closes: #571638)
  * Move up to debhelper 7.  (Closes: #624175)
  * Fix 'Files:' option to expect an install _directory_.  (Closes: #636310)

    Based on patch from era erickson.  (Closes: #409557)
  * Improve option handling: allow equivs-build --arch and --full to work
    together.  Previously, with --full, --arch had no effect.

equivs (2.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU, thanks Zack.
  * Also thanks Tomáš Pospíšek for several patches.
  * Use dpkg-buildpackage instead of debuild; drop devscripts dependency.
    (Closes: #475936)
  * Stop specifying debhelper >=4, redundant in this day and age.  At the
    same time, I don't see the point in specifying a higher compat level.
  * Update and improve package description somewhat.  (Closes: #464871)
  * Document including multiple files via the "Files:" field:
    manpage (Closes: #565897), template file (Closes: #464888).
  * Allow +x bit to be specified on File: line.  (Closes: #535622)
  * Preserve +x bit for files in Files: section.  (Closes: #535623)
  * Allow Homepage field.  (Closes: #502395)
  * Fix Makefile pod2man rule.  (Closes: #364620)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes).
  * Honor $DEBEMAIL, $EMAIL, $DEBFULLNAME, and /etc/mailname for the
    default maintainer address.

equivs (2.0.7-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * equivs-build: add support for adding arbitrary extra files to a package.
    Thanks to Anthony Towns for the patch (Closes: #449542)
  * equivs-build: use date -R instead of deprecated 822-date.
    Thanks to Guillem Jover. (Closes: #415797)
  * equivs-build.pod: document the new "Files:" and "File:" fields
  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no changes needed
  * debian/control: move debhelper dependency to Build-Depends, so that it is
    available upon clean

 -- Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jan 2008 12:26:38 +0100

equivs (2.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.  (Closes: #350835)
  * Acknowledge NMU.  (Closes: #201852, #218443, #237963, #251547)
  * Add file COPYING, the GNU GPL v2, to top level of source tree.
  * Update both build-time and runtime use of debhelper to v4.
    (Closes: #320619)
  * debian/copyright, debian/rules: cleanups
  * debian/control:
    - standards version 3.6.2 (no changes needed)
    - rewrite description
    - drop 'perl5' alternative dependency; the perl5 package disappeared
      about 3 release cycles ago
  * template/debian/copyright: update FSF address.
  * template/debian/control.in: edit description, set maintainer to
    root@localhost, update standards version, add correct debhelper
    Build-Depends
  * template/debian/rules: streamline somewhat.
  * equivs-build: support Replaces: field.  (Closes: #118526)
  * equivs-build, template/debian/README.Debian.in:
    use "@" instead of the ISO-8859-1 section symbol for the variable
    escapes, to make life slightly easier for users of other charsets.
    - equivs-build.pod: update (and fix) the documentation for this
  * equivs-build: allow comments in control file.
    - template.ctl: comment out most of the entries, to save the user some
      time in common cases.  Also mention that packages lists are all
      comma-separated.
  * equivs-build: Lots of code cleanups.  Highlights:
    - Use File::Temp::tempdir.  This removes the dir upon normal exit.  On
      abend, tell the user where it is so she can examine and remove it.
    - Print usage message to STDERR, not STDOUT
    - Actually bother to close all the files we open
    - die with "\n".  I doubt users care about source code line numbers.
    - 3-arg open(), multi-arg system(), and in general try to look less
      like Perl 4
    - Delete outdated or useless comments, commented-out code, unneeded
      variables, and redundant integrity checks
    - Eliminate most use of global variables
    The net effect is to shrink the file by about 20%.

    use own files 
  * Renamed make-control to equivs-control and
            make-equivs to equivs-build

equivs (1.999.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Maintainer
  * Complete rewrite. Instead recreating the equivs package, one now
    creates new fake packages
  * No problem with apt anymore. To apt, the information fetched from 
    it's sources has precedence over information hold localy by dpkg.
    So a recompiled equivs packages was not recognised correctly.
  * Changed versionnumber to a debian-only one.

 -- Martin Bialasinski <martinb@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jan 1999 12:35:16 +0100

equivs (1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Complete overhaul (and hopefully simplification) of "equivs".
  * Updated README.debian with a clearer description of the package's 
    usage and instructions on how to remove it again. I hope "equivs"
    is pretty foolproof by now.
  * Changed debian/rules and the preinst/postinst files to use the
    configuration file "/etc/equivs.conf".
  * Added debian/purge file.

 -- Paul Seelig <pseelig@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>  Sat, 07 Feb 1998 16:34:32 +0100

    information which enabled me to make up this package. ;-)

  * Various changes to debian/rules so that the current configuration is
    added to the documentation as "/usr/doc/equivs/current.conf".

 -- Paul Seelig <pseelig@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>  Mon, 29 Sep 1997 22:24:03 +0100
